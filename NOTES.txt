Implements:
ARC SST retrievals (n2, n3, d2, d3) for ATSR1, ATSR2, AATSR
ATSR Saharan Dust Index for ATSR1, ATSR2, AATSR

To do:

Sometimes outputs appear corrupted in SNAP - not sure if this is a problem in Java code or just a broken development environment.

Option to use NWP TCWV if data is available. Nadir-view especially will be biased if TCWV is not available.
Alternatively generate "global" SST coefficients (will be inferior to ARC retrievals and will have to wait for CCI retrieval work)

Output uncertainty information, will require L1b uncertainty information expected in SLSTR L1b and future versions of ATSR L1b (also requires NWP TCWV as input)

Update AATSR coefficients to account for different treatment of AATSR 12 micron anomaly (current coefficients assume the input L1b data has been adjusted as was the case with ARC processing, future CCI coefficients will work directly with current L1b)

Option to return all 4 ARC SSTs - so that "day" (e.g. d2) and "night" (e.g. d3) can be directly compared on night-time conditions where both retrievals work

Option to return standard dual and nadir retrievals - i.e. n2/d2 for day and twilight (twilight threshold should be controlled by UI)

Should we include an option to filter data based on ASDI or dual-nadir difference (this would be easy to do in SNAP after processing so maybe we shouldn't include it in the ARC processor)

Automatically detect the sensor (atsr1 / atsr2 / aatsr / slstr) from the input product and select appropriate coefficient files.

Merge 4 ARC retrievals (n2,n3,d2,d3) into single coef file as done with original ARC files

Write coeffient reader compatible with original ARC files rather than converting ARC files to Java property format?
